9.  After installing the above, your system is ready to perform.
10. By installing 'anaconda navigator', by default "Jupiter Notebook" also installed in your system.
11. Open Jupiter Notebook and select new file, we are performing this code in python programming language so select pypthon.
12. Copy the source code provided and paste it in Jupiter Note book.
13. We have some 'haar cascade files', 'model' and 'alarm'.
14. Give the above files paths in the code with respect to their slots in code.
